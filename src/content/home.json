In the approximately 10 months we worked together at Advanced Circuits, I observed Paul take on a variety of crucial roles in the delicate business of circuit board production. Paul completed upwards of 40 chemical analyses each day in order to supervise the performance of many chemical plating baths. He was also trained how to balance and perform maintenance on a complex system of ion exchange machines which process waste water produced in the plating factory. While listing all of Paul professional responsibilities would be impractical in this short recommendation; I’ll lastly add his role in completing circuit board quality control tasks to ensure the viability of products at Advanced Circuits.\n\nPaul has a strong focus on the work in front of him. He showed interest and motivation in expanding his knowledge and expertise in circuit board production.\n\nI wish Paul good luck in his future endeavors wherever they lead.",
